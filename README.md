#Samples Agent
This module contains the USI Sample Agent which is the agent in charge of mediating the comunication between USI and [BioSamples](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/). This agent will submit new samples, update and fetch existing ones. It has an external dependency on [BioSamples v4.0.0](https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/biosamples-v4), which at this point is still under active development.
##Getting started
This is a Spring Boot application, to run it you'll have to download the entire subs project, this agent parent project.
