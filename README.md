#Samples Agent
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EMBL-EBI-SUBS/subs.svg?branch=SUBS-287-samples-agent)](https://travis-ci.org/EMBL-EBI-SUBS/subs)
Under active development on branch [SUBS-287-samples-agent](https://github.com/EMBL-EBI-SUBS/subs/tree/SUBS-287-samples-agent)

This module contains the USI Sample Agent which is the agent in charge of mediating the comunication between USI and [BioSamples](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/). This agent will submit new samples, update and fetch existing ones. It has an external dependency on [BioSamples v4.0.0](https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/biosamples-v4), which at this point is still under active development. The agent 'listens' to two queues from RabbitMQ and processes  three types of requests:
- Submission of new samples
- Update of existing samples
- Fetching existing samples
